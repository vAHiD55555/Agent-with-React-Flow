# Overview

This example showcases how to send emails with a Restack workflow using the sendgrid api. You can easily choose another email provider and update the code.
You can schedule two scenarios of the workflow.

1. It will be successfull and send an email.
2. The email content generation step will fail once to showcase how Restack handles retries automatically. Once failure is caught, step will be retry automatically and rest of workflow will be executed as expected and email will be sent.

# Requirements

- Node 20 or higher

```bash
brew install nvm
nvm use 20
```

# Install Restack Web UI

To install the Restack Web UI, you can use Docker.

```bash
docker run -d --pull always --name restack -p 5233:5233 -p 6233:6233 -p 7233:7233 -p 9233:9233 ghcr.io/restackio/restack:main
```

# Start services

Where all your code is defined, including workflow steps.

add OPENAI_API_KEY, SENDGRID_API_KEY, FROM_EMAIL, TO_EMAIL in .env

```bash
npm i
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Your code will be running and syncing with Restack engine to execute workflows or functions.

# Schedule workflow to send email

In another shell:

```bash
npm run schedule
```

Will schedule to start example workflow immediately. The code for this is on `scheduleWorkflow.ts`. In here you can see how the sendEmailWorkflow is scheduled to be executed.

# Schedule workflow to send email with simulated failure and retries

In another shell:

```bash
npm run schedule-retries
```

This will schedule the example workflow to start immediately. The code for this is in `scheduleWorkflowRetries.ts`. In this file, you can see how the `sendEmailWorkflow` is scheduled for execution. The step to generate email content is intentionally set to fail once, demonstrating how Restack automatically handles retries. After the first failure, the step will succeed on the next retry, and the remaining steps in the workflow will execute as expected.

## Deploy on Restack Cloud

To deploy the application on Restack, you can create an account at [Restack Console](https://console.restack.io)
