This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Install Restack Web UI 

To install the Restack Web UI, you can use Docker.
```
docker run -d --pull always --name restack -p 5233:5233 -p 6233:6233 -p 7233:7233 -p 9233:9233 ghcr.io/restackio/restack:main
```
# Schedule Restack workflow from NextJS frontend

The example is a NextJS application with front and backend. You can schedule the workflow example from the user interface. 

![Example UI](./restack-examples-ts-nextjs.png)

When the client successfully schedules the workflow, you can see the started workflow in the Restack Web UI. You should see the following screen:

![Success Web UI](./restack-examples-ts-nextjs-web-ui.png)

Now you can add a backend to the example. In other examples, you can see how to ideally structure the backend app with workflows, functions and services.
