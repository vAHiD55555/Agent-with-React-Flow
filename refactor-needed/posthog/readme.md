# Motivation

We built this to autonomous AI to watch Posthog Session Recording and create a digest on Linear (optional)

Its using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to analyse recordings.
And OpenAI O1-preview to reason and create a digest in Markdown.

By default we retrieve all recodings from last 24 hours, so by scheduling the workflow to run every day we get a digest of all new recordings.
